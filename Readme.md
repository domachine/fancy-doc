# fancy-doc

  Document component based projects using markdown.  `fancy-doc` uses a given
  root directory and serves the documentation of all contained projects.  It
  assumes that the project has a `component.json` file within its top-level
  directory which is used to determine the submodules.  See
  [project-view](lib/project-view) for the ReST-style api.

## Usage

  `fancy-doc` operates on a directory which contains multiple *component-based*
  projects.  A project with components has the following structure:

    project-name/
      component.json
      ...

  The `component.json` should at least include the name of the project.
  `fancy-doc` then reads the `paths` key from the `component.json` (see
  [component.json (spec)](https://github.com/component/component/wiki/Spec)) to
  get where the modules of the project reside.  Each of these modules can
  include a `Readme.md` file which is linked by `fancy-doc`.

  So now you should have a structure like the following:

    root/
      project-name/
        component.json
        ...

  Now start `fancy-doc`

    $ bin/fancy-doc --root path/to/root

  and point your favorite internet browser to
  `http://localhost:3000/projects/project-name/` to browse your documentation.

  Happy hacking!
